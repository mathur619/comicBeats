Big things come in small packages. Just an age-old cliché, right? Actually, it turns out there’s quite a bit of truth to it…if you’re talking about the Atom.

A gifted physicist, Dr. Ray Palmer put his genius mind to good use by laboring tirelessly to help create a better world. His hard work led to advancements in matter compression and the discovery of white-dwarf star remnants on Earth. Creating a specialized, size-changing belt that houses a lens filled with star matter, Ray has the ability to shrink his size down to subatomic levels. This unique power inspired his heroic moniker and allows the Atom to handle things most other heroes can’t even see: viruses, parasites, nuclear reactions and beyond. Using phone, fiber-optic cables and even the bloodstreams of other heroes and villains, Ray can get wherever he needs to be at incredible speeds.
