NON-PLAYER CHARACTER ASSASSINATION! What is MACHINE MAN’S problem with (our) IRON MAN of 2018? When TONY STARK unveils his latest innovation, the Great eScape, AARON STACK realizes what it will mean for all the artificial life-forms of the Marvel Universe...blue checks or DEATH! Also in this issue: A new development for JOCASTA. ANDY dates a single mom (no, really, this is important). And that classic Iron Man villain you’ve been talking about since the first issue? Theyyyyy’re back. Mwahaha!
